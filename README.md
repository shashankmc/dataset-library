# dataset-library

Search public legal datasets by **license** and **task** from a Flask app, and
(from a later release) import a sample as the host's own Dataset. Built for
[BAIGLE](https://github.com/shashankmc/reducing_digital_divide), where law
students start with no data.

v0.1.0 searches the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).

## Installing into a host

```python
from dataset_library import init_dataset_library

init_dataset_library(
    app,
    db=db,                          # the host's Flask-SQLAlchemy handle
    login_required=jwt_required(),  # the host's sign-in decorator
    current_owner=get_jwt_identity,
    task_types=[t["value"] for t in TASK_TYPES],  # legal-ml-core's task types
    cache=RedisJSONCache(redis),    # get(key) / set(key, value, ttl)
)
```

Create the tables from `dataset_library.models.LibraryBase.metadata`, or add
`dataset_library/migrations/versions` to Alembic's `version_locations` (branch
label `dataset_library`).

## API

- `GET /api/library/search?q=&task=&license=&source=` →
  `{"status": "ok" | "stale" | "unavailable", "results": [...], "count": n}`.
  `stale`: the Hub is limiting requests and these are the last results, up to a
  day old. `unavailable`: the Hub is down or unreadable; nothing is raised.
- `GET /api/library/labels?ids=huggingface:org/name,...` → `{"labels": {id: "yes" | "no" | "unclear"}}`,
  from the dataset viewer's column types; up to 30 ids, cached an hour each.
- `GET /api/library/datasets/huggingface/<org>/<name>?config=&split=` → the
  card plus `configs`, `config`, `split`, `columns`, the first `rows`, `labels`
  and `preview: "ok" | "unavailable"`.
- `GET /api/library/options` → the task, license and source filters, and the
  license table (`level` is this platform's: `allow`, `warn` or `hide`).

## Licenses

`dataset_library.licenses` is the one vocabulary. Each license has flags
(`nc`, `nd`, `sa`, `unknown`), a default level (`warn` for non-commercial,
no-derivatives and unknown licenses, `allow` otherwise), and for `warn` the
condition and the confirmation a student reads before importing. A license
tag nobody recognises resolves to `unknown`.

## Security

Only `https://huggingface.co/api/datasets` and `https://datasets-server.huggingface.co` are called, with parameters built by
the package. Descriptions are returned as plain text for the host to escape.

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[test]"
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Tests never call the Hub: `tests/fixtures/huggingface` holds recorded answers.
